### Why should data scientists learn web dev?

----

## Answers!

- Visualization - show off that data!
- Gather - scraping, accessing (and parsing) web apis
- Interaction - get people to interact with and add more data

## Real Python

1. Learn Python and web development practically
1. [Kickstarters](https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/721054906/real-python-advanced-web-development-featuring-dja?ref=nav_search)
1. [Course philosophy](https://realpython.com/courses/) - bottom up, test-driven, language before framework
1. [Flask By Example](https://realpython.com/blog/python/flask-by-example-part-1-project-setup/)

Note: Started in 2012 by Fletcher Heisler since there were no into to Python courses. I came on for the Kickstarter and to edit, and then launched course 2 focusing on web development. Focus is on open source and quality blog posts to attract people.
